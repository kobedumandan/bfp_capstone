"""
Process-pool workers for CPU-bound route computation.

Each pool process loads the road graph + GNN engine ONCE (in `init_worker`),
then answers pure-compute requests. This gives the routing work real
parallelism across processes instead of serializing behind the API process's
GIL. Only primitive args/results cross the process boundary — no DB objects,
no engine — so everything stays picklable and cheap to ship.

DB reads (obstructions, incident coords) and all DB writes stay in the parent
API process; these workers do graph math only.
